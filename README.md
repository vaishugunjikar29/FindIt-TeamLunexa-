# FindIt-TeamLunexa-
In today’s fast-paced, urbanized world, losing personal belongings—such as wallets, mobile phones, documents, keys, and even pets—is a common issue. The absence of a centralized platform for reporting or searching for lost and found items often results in unclaimed belongings and difficulties in recovery.

Project Aim: This project seeks to address the problem by developing FINDIT, a Lost & Found website where users can post details of lost or found items, including images, descriptions, categories, dates, and contact information. The platform will provide advanced filtering options by category, date, and location, making it easier to connect lost items with their rightful owners and promote honesty and community assistance through a digital solution using technology.
